                <h3>Biographies</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>Akil Henry:</strong> Musician, data analyst & podcaster. Whilst completing a degree in Mathematics and Music at the 
                  University of Birmingham, he started One Sound Music with some friends with the ambition to give platforms to Adventist artists,
                who typically haven’t been part of the gospel/Christian music mainstream market.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Tochi Anu:</strong> Guitar, choral direction, songwriting, photography - Tochi’s a true creative to his core. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Antonia Gregory:</strong> Like the other team members, Antonia has an extremely diverse musical background, 
                  from singing background vocals for Jahmene Douglas (who had a UK no 1 album a few years back), to sound engineering 
                  (which she is finishing up a degree in at the moment from the University of West London). Years of singing in church 
                  and an innate musical ability have allowed her to develop a keen ear, which she uses to her advantage as a sound engineer 
                  and as a vocalist.

            <article>
                <p>I love acoustic music! It is so calming and soothing. So one day, I was on YouTube searching for a song, and I 
                    came across the One Sound Music channel. Over the years, I have grown to love the "Christmas Countdown" videos and artist release
                    videos. I like the artist because:

                    <ol>
                      <li>Their songs have great messages.</li>
                      <li>Most of the artist are my age.</li>
                      <li>I love that they created this grassroot project.</li>
